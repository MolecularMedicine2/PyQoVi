### PyQoVi -Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE
Based on the Paper: Deep Transfer Learning approach for automatic recognition of drug toxicity and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 <br>
Data are avaible at: <br>
Implemented in Python using the PyTorch Framework<br>
We provide the code to be able to analyse different active substances automatically and quickly on the basis of the imaging. Due to the topicality of the epidemic, we provide a solution here.

# Installation Guide (ATM Windows Only)
1.Step: Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and git clone the repo. Or just download the zip folder.<br>

<img src="/images/CMD.PNG" alt="CMD" title="CMD" />
2.Step: Install Anaconda and create a Python interpreter (Python 3.8.5) <br>
(https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)<br>
3.Step: Install Pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/ <br> and choose the anaconda interpreter from you installation before

4.Step: install the packages from the requirement.txt by calling pip install -r requirements.txt in the python console <br>

# How to Use Guide GUI (ATM Windows Only)
1.Step: Training: Use our GUI: run start_app.py. 
<img src="/images/start_app.PNG" alt="start_app" title="start_app" />
Training: Enter a name for the model (model_file_name). Select the path with the Training, Validation and Test Data.<br>
Inference: Inference: Enter a name for the resultfile (result_file_name). Load a trained model by selecting the path. (.pth). The choose the folder for the data, you want analyze.<br>
3.Step: You find the result as csv-file in result folder and the trained model in the saved_models folder. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
# How to Use Guide CMD (ATM Windows Only)
First adjust the paths in the parameter_holder.py <br>
-file_path_train='./data/cpetox', Path to you Data (with subfolders train, test, val) and for this subfolders for the different classes<br>
-folder_path='./data/inference', Path tho Folder with images you want classify <br>
-reload_path='./saved_models/train_model_resnet_19_02___22_15_36.pth', Path to the trained model <br>

<br>
1.Step: Load the TrainingValidationTest dataset for train by using the train_public.py function (run in your IDE or cmd) or the download a pretrained model from.... <br>

Add Link <br>
2.Step: Put your pictues into the inference folder and run infer_public.py with your IDE or in the cmd line (Hint use the right env python interpreter) <br>

<img src="/images/ProjectFolder.PNG" alt="Projectfolder" title="Projectfolder" />
3.Step: You find the result as csv-file in result folder and the trained model in the saved_models folder. <br>
